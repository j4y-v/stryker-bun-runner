     * Keyed by sha256(cwd + ':' + ppid): every worker process Stryker spawns
     * for one run is a direct child of that run's single Stryker main
     * process, so all of them share BOTH process.cwd() (the sandbox
     * directory) AND process.ppid (the main process's pid) — and therefore
     * independently derive this SAME path with no coordination required. A
     * worker recycled mid-run is still a child of the same main process, so
     * it re-derives the same path too (README documents recycled instances
     * lazily loading the registry). This is the entire sharing contract:
     * writer (buildAndPersistTestRegistry) and reader (loadRegistryFile) both
     * go through this one getter rather than reimplementing the formula, so
     * they can never disagree by construction.
     *
     * process.ppid is what makes this safe for this repo's own dogfooding:
     * this plugin's own unit/integration tests run INSIDE a Stryker sandbox as
     * the system under test, as children of the sandbox WORKER process, not
     * of the Stryker main process — so those inner test processes hash a
     * different ppid and land on a different file, and can never clobber the
     * outer run's registry. A worker-unique key (e.g. the STRYKER_MUTATOR_WORKER
     * env var Stryker injects per forked worker) was considered and rejected
     * for the same reason it would break the cross-worker sharing above: it
     * uniquely identifies each worker, not the run.
     *
     * process.cwd() is read directly (not resolved via fs.realpathSync):
     * Stryker's child-process-proxy-worker computes every worker's chdir
     * target via a pure path.resolve() of an identical IPC string, so all
     * workers of a run already get a byte-identical process.cwd() with no
     * symlink divergence to guard against — realpath would only add a
     * syscall (and a new ENOENT failure mode if the sandbox dir is mid-
     * teardown) for no benefit.
     *
     * Using a getter that reads process.cwd()/process.ppid at call time
     * (rather than caching at construction) ensures the path resolves against

   * Guards against the inspector event stream silently truncating mid-run
   * (observed under CI runner contention): bun's own child-side coverage file
   * can be complete while the inspector-derived `executionOrder` is cut off at
   * a file boundary, and everything downstream of that (test results, coverage
   * attribution) accepted the truncated data silently — a plausible-looking
   * but corrupted score, not a loud failure.
   *
   * ONLY evaluated when the run otherwise looks GREEN (zero Failed entries in
   * the already-built `tests`): an already-failing dry run is handled by
   * {@link checkDryRunProcessResult} / {@link warnOnUnidentifiedDryRunFailure},
   * and this precondition structurally prevents a failing beforeAll (which
   * marks the rest of its describe/file Failed) from ever reaching Signal A —
   * the incident's own signature was a run that looked completely healthy.
   *
   * Fires (returns a DryRunStatus.Error result) iff EITHER signal is material:
   *
   * - Signal A (execution/console shortfall): `consoleTotal` (bun's SUMMARY
   *   pass+fail counts — deliberately NOT the parser's max(per-line, summary)
   *   fields, so per-ATTEMPT retry output can never inflate it — see
   *   ParsedTestResults.summaryPassed/summaryFailed) compared against the
   *   count of ids in `executionOrder` whose status is neither 'skip' nor
   *   bun's not-yet-implemented placeholder-test status. Retries do not
   *   create a shortfall in this direction: empirically (bun 1.3.14), a
   *   retried test fires ONE TestReporter.start per ATTEMPT for the SAME
   *   inspector id — so executionOrder, if anything, grows on retries, and
   *   bun's summary line counts tests, not attempts, either way. A material
   *   shortfall must clear both an absolute floor and a ratio floor.
   *
   * - Signal B (orphaned coverage keys): `orphanedKeyCount` (a whole file's
   *   coverage keys unpaired with any inspector test — see coverage-mapper.ts)
   *   exceeding a small absolute floor. Deliberately gate-blind for the legacy
   *   ("test-N") coverage format, which never populates this count — Signal A
   *   still covers that path since it does not depend on coverage format.
   *
   * `wasClosedUnexpectedly` is NEVER a standalone trigger — the WS-vs-child-exit
   * close race can plausibly be true on a nontrivial fraction of healthy runs —
   * it is folded into the Error message only as corroborating context once the
   * gate has already fired via Signal A or B.
   *
   * @returns A DryRunStatus.Error result if the gate fires, otherwise null.
